      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Rana Regime in Nepal, lasting from 1846 to 1951, was characterized by the centralized power of the Rana family.
        During this time, the Ranas maintained strict control over the country’s political and social systems, leading to an era marked by isolation, modernization under controlled conditions, and the consolidation of power.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The regime was established after the Kot Massacre in 1846, when Jung Bahadur Rana rose to power. Over the following decades,
        the Rana rulers controlled Nepal’s administration, foreign relations, and military affairs. Despite some efforts to modernize the country,
        their rule was often criticized for suppressing democratic movements and limiting political freedoms.

      <h2>Key Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jung Bahadur Rana</strong> – The founder of the Rana dynasty whose leadership changed the course of Nepalese history.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsequent Rana Leaders</strong> – Various Rana prime ministers who continued the autocratic governance until the regime's end.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Rana era left a mixed legacy in Nepal. On one hand, the regime is remembered for its role in shaping modern Nepal,
        including infrastructural development and administrative reforms. On the other, it is often critiqued for its undemocratic practices and
        the long-lasting impact on Nepal’s political landscape, which eventually led to a push for democratic reforms and the end of Rana rule.
